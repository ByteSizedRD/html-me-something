        <h3>About Me</h3>
        
        <p>I'm May, a thirty-something nerdette who is more than mildly obsessesed with learning new things all the time.   I am a professionally licensed Registered Dietitian (RD),
        a mom to two fuzzy fur butts, a wife to a fuzzy faced nerd, an artist who dabbles in many different mediums, a woman that's weirdly passionate about jellyfish, 
        an obsessive reader, a whimsical gamer, and a fantastic cook (but a terrible baker). </p>

        <h3>My Ikigai</h3>

       <p> There is a japanese concept known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ikigai" target="_blank">"Ikigai"</a> that means "a reason for being".  Its often used describe doing not just what you need to do for 
        living; but doing what brings your passion to life also.  For as long as I can remember my "ikigai" has been in a state of flux.</p>  

        <p>In my early 20's I thought my passion was just in being recognized; working long hours and going above & beyond to meet the expecations of my superiors 
        just so I could hear those words "Good job".  However, burnout and ennui eventually reared their heads when the reality of how even hard workers would 
        sometimes still be the casuality of downsizing.  In my mid 20's/early 30's I thought that my ikigai came from my passion about health & wellness; stemming from a 
        life long battle with my weight and wanting a career that could make my family proud of me. However, after completing college, an internship,
        and working as a dietitian; I acknoweledged the reality that it was a good career, but not the right fit. Now in my mid 30's I've taken another leap forward 
        towards my ikigai, but this time with wisdom to reflect on what my ikigai really could be.  In this thought, LaunchCode has become part of that experiance. </p>

        <h3>Hello, LaunchCode</h3>

        <p>When I first met my husband, he tried to teach me how to code.  I was enraptured by all the amazing things you could do just by knowing even a little bit of HTML, 
        but as coding kept becoming a "one day" project; nothing much stuck over time as the rest of life became louder and busier....and even LOUDER...and even BUSIER. 
        Life soon became the feeling I dreaded.  Waking up with intentions of just getting through the day.  Getting through the day and dreading doing it all over tomorrow.
        My ikigai was a wistful dream, this was the "reality" I had wished on myself by taking a path I thought I needed to take.  A sense of dread filled me as I thought
        of how much time I had "wasted"</p>

        <p>It was my husband who pointed out LaunchCode to me initially, but at the time my life as a dietitian felt too consuming to have room for other thoughts. Over time 
        I would see friends go through LaunchCode and hear their joy at not just learning a new skill, but the world the program opened up for them.  My friend Katie just
        graduated from LaunchCode and I can't begin to express how much joy I've heard her gain from both learning & the meeting </p>
