      <h2>Career Paths: About as Straight As I Am</h2>
        
       <p>Excluding earning money by babysitting dogs, cleaning houses, or mowing lawns; my very first job was as a fish monger.  I remember having to tell the incredulous
       manager that I was being serious, that yes as a teen girl I wanted to work with fish instead of something cleaner like a bagger girl or a cart runner.
       Why a fish monger?  I think at the time it had the appeal of being something I knew nothing about.  We didn't eat a lot of seafood at home, so this was a chance to 
       both work and learn something new each day. </p>
       
       <p> Other jobs along the way taught me about things I'd never have a chance to learn otherwise: differnt types of coffee (barista), how a kitchen works behind the sceens (line cook), 
       how many safety dummies can fit in a bag (Safety trainer), what its like to reorganize about 60 years worth of contracts(admin assistant), how to change a bed without the 
       person getting out of it(nursing home aide), and most importantly: How to ask for help with I need it (every single job I've ever worked).  Okay, I've learned that one outside
       of my career also; but learning how to ask for help while in a work position is a hard lesson for many to learn and actually utilize. </p>

       <p>My career prior to exploring LaunchCode was as a Registered Dietitian; working in the profession that answers the question "what should I be eating".  Most of the time the answer
       is as simple as quoting Michael Pollan with "Eat food, not too much, mostly plants".  Sometimes though there are individual allergies, diseases, or age related issues that 
       require a more insightful answer.  As a dietitian focused on geriatric and post-hospital care, my focus was primarily on getting patients enough calories without exacerbating
       pre-existing conditions; such as diabetes, crohns disease, or kidney disease.  It was a career where learning wasn't just encouraged, but required as all RDs have a mandaorty
       75 credits of extracurricular lessons they need to keep their professional licensure active. </p>

       <p>During a recent conference on obesity prevention the topic of telehealth came up and it opened up a whole world of increasing demand that RD's will see in the near future for 
       more accessable nutrition counseling and advice.  On top of that, it showed me that I was lacking a whole skill set that was rapidly becoming as necessary as knowing how to 
       use a computer had been for my mothers generation.  A short while later I found myself discussing possibly expanding my career set </p>
